     * other registrations with their values, once they are registered. See `validateRegistration` for more details.
     * 2. The name of the registration is generated: `Mod<modname><registration.name (in pascal case, with all non-letters removed)>`
     * 3. If the registration contains a `description` field, sets the `modIndex` property in the description to this mod's index.
     * 4. If the registration is not "basic", IE: it needs to do something besides allocate an enum, it will have an entry in a switch
     * block for its `registration.type`. If it doesn't, by default it just allocates the enum using `registrationTypeToEnumMap`.
